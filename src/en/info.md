Elena Mukosey is a young artist, who is just starting her journey in illustration. She was born on February 12, 2006 in Moscow into a family of architects.
Elena began drawing in her early childhood. At the age of 8, she started attending an art studio led by the artist and illustrator Irina Pilosyan at the Ester Children’s Center. During her 10 years there, she took part not only in annual in-house exhibitions but also in the regional children’s drawing contest named after Nadia Rusheva. In 2016 Elena won the 2nd place for her illustration to the story "A lion and a dog" by L.N.Tolstoy, and in 2019 she won, accordingly, 1st and 2nd place for the illustration to the Russian folk tale "Bad Wife", and for the artwork "Picasso-style self-portrait on a chemical background".
Creating illustrations to "The Little Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry for the 10th grade school project (2022 – 2023) became a crucial moment on Elena’s creative path. According to her, this work greatly influenced her decision to become an illustrator.
In her artworks, Elena focuses on reflecting the expressions and emotions of the characters. This approach helps her illustrations to complement the texts in a more natural way.
Among her creative references Elena names illustrators such as Viktoria Semiakina and Igor Oleynikov. She is also inspired by artists like Mikhail Vrubel, Aubrey Beardsley, and Hayao Miyazaki.
